## API Key

This project uses two APIs from API Ninjas (https://api-ninjas.com). These require an API key for access.

To run this project, add a file named "api-key.js" to the assets/js directory.

The api-key.js file must contain the following line of code:
```js
const apiKey = 'your-api-ninjas-api-key-here';
```
