## TailwindCSS Components

This site uses TailwindCSS components from https://components.dev.screencraft.net.au/components/.

Section    | Component       | Notes
-----------|-----------------|------
Header     | Sticky Header   |
Navigation |                 | Screencraft Components do not currently include any navigation components. Maybe I can adapt the code from the Screencraft Components websiteâ€™s own navigation bar, although it is not responsive on mobile.
Body: Portfolio Phases| Card (Vertical) |I will omit the footer on these components as it is not needed for this project.
Footer     | Simple Footer   |
